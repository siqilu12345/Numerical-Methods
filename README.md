# Numerical-Methods
This repository contains my work for solving a numeric problem. The problem is min ||z^4-1||^2, where z=x+iy. It is obvious that this question has 4 solutions. I use three different ways to solve the problem as required, they are steepest descend method, Newton's method, Conjugate gradient method. The three pictrures show the result of the work. Different color represents different points that the method converge.
